              We all know we can create React component using JSX and then render them on the web using React DOM. We also have access to incredible features like the state or the component lifecycle, but what is actually happening behind the scenes ?

              A React component that returns React element using JSX, the JavaScript XML. For React, the return value is an object. When we call the component, we get the real return value.

              When we Write a component it's a pure JavaScript code. We need to convert this JaavaScript code to HTML, beacouse that we saw in browser, everything is html code. For this convert prosses we use React, and this is prossesing in React DOM. React DOM helps to generate JS code in HTML file and this prosses is happen without reload the browser page.

              <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
